    ANS-<p> Firstly we have a function (counter) in which we declare a variable assign a value(0)
        then a innerfunction declare name as (IncreaseCounter) in which we return a Previously declare (variable+=1)
        then outer function returns innerfunction name. Now we call the function (counter) and stores in counter variable.
        Now console the counter variable like function.
         first time, we call innerfunction (it return from function(counter) and take the value of variable from closure
        (outside the function) and increment with 1 and console the output "1").
        On second time, we call same innerfunction. So value of variable has already taken from first call. Then return the value by increment the previouslly taken value. The Output is "2".
        On third time, we call same function, So like above function calling, The ouput is "3".
        And So on, The output is "4".</p>

            (function () {
              if (count === 0) {
                let count = 1;
                console.log(count); // What is logged?
              }

            })();"</pre></h2>
            <br>
            ANS-<p>Firstly declare a variable and asign the value (0).Now declare the function and call directly.
                  In function, we take the condition if previously declared variable is 0. Then create a new variable named same as previously declared variable and assign value (1). Now console this variable. Then close the condition.
                now console same variable.
                On first console, count variable exist in if condition, So The output is "1"
                On Second console, count variable does not in function scope, So it will find in global scope. The output is "0"</p>

                    }, 1000);

                  <br>
                  ANS-<p>We know that var is function scoped variable, so it will store the value whenever the value change.In this (for) loop, the value of i is (0) which is less then (3), 
                    so it will go in the loop and execute the settimeout function.
                    Now the value of i will become (1) with increment of 1, so it will again go in the loop and execute the settimeout function.
                    Now the value of i will become (2) with increment of 1, so it will again go in the loop and execute the settimeout function.
                    Now the value of i will become (3) with increment of 1, but it is not less than (3). so it will not go in the loop.
                    Now if we talking about settimeout function. This function will execute after 1000 miliseconds or 1 seconds. We already know that the execution time of (for) loop 
                    function is less than 1 miliseconds, So all three execution of settimeout function will execute after the execution of (for) loop. So in settimeout function, there is a
                     console the value of (i). So at the end of (for) loop, the value of i is (3). So the function is print the (3) for three times.</p>
